      <description># Username availability https://namechk.com/ # Another service (290 tests) https://whatsmyname.app/ Socialscan (https://github.com/iojw/socialscan) # Many tools used to check if an account exists comes with false positive # 100% accuracy: Rather than scanning profile pages, socialscan queries the  # registration servers of the platforms directly, retrieving the appropriate # CSRF tokens, headers, and cookies.  # This eliminates all false positives/negatives, ensuring that results are accurate. # Speed: socialscan uses asyncio along with aiohttp to conduct all  # queries concurrently, resulting in very quick searching even with bulk queries.</description>
